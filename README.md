# Refactor-Assignment-Horiseon

## What I did for this challenge:
* Edited the HTML file to clean it up and make it more easily readable
* Added alt text for the appropriate images for accessability (tested with a screen reader)
* Ensured all the links were properly functioning
* Compiled several repeated lines of CSS code to make it cleaner
* Adjusted several <div>'s to give more context to the code and help maintain a flow
* Made sure the CSS file's order matched the HTML file
